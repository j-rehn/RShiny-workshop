# Welcome

Welcome to our **RShiny Workshop** proudly supported by the SA COMBINE committee.

Shiny is an R package which allows you to build interactive webpages
with R (No knowledge of html/CSS or webpage development required!).

This workshop will provide an introduction to Shiny and allow you to
build several simple apps to get a feel for how Shiny works and what you
can do.

## Pre-requisites

The tutorial is designed for those who already have some knowledge or `R` and `Rstudio`.
You will need to have both installed on your computer. 

Additionally, you will need to install the R package `Shiny` and some other useful packages for building apps.
Click on the **Getting Started** tab at the top of this site for complete install and setup instructions.
